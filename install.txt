The commands needed to run our program are as follows 

to compile: g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++17 -g main.cpp algorithms.cpp display.cpp features.cpp Matrix.cpp -o main.exe -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
to run: ./main.exe


- The operating system that was used for this project was WSL: Ubuntu 22.04.1
- The only dependency needed for this project is SFML 

Directions: 

Once the program is compiled and run, the command line will prompt you for different inputs which will eventually lead
to the program printing out a result that is either an apartment layout or a message telling you why your
requested layout is not possible. It may take around 10-20 seconds for the user to get the result back (make take longer
if there is a large amount of rooms or a really big layout). If an apartment is able to be created by an algorithm then 
a SFML window should pop up and allow you to view a drawing of the apartment layout. There will be a key printed in the 
terminal to show which colors represent which rooms. Once this is finished, if you want to try out another layout simply 
close the SFML window and re compile the code. 

** It is recommended to set the initital room size to 60 by 40 and to go up in small increments if rooms do not fit **
